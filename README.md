**yeastseqNet** aims to infer the transcriptome stability in *S. cerevisiae* using only 
sequential data. The convolutional neural network is built using three distinct convolutional 
units to gather sequential information from the ORF and the major transcript isoforms of 
the 5'- and the 3'UTR. In its current form, it is able to predict mRNA half-lives with state-of-the-art accuracy.
